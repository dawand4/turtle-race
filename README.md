# turtle-race
Simple Python betting game broadly using the Turtle module, as well as the Random module and Screen methods.

# THIS APPLICATION IS ONLY AVAILABLE IN THE POLISH LANGUAGE

The following code uses the Turtle and Random module to generate five turtle icons in random colors. Using Screen methods, the player can bet on which of the turtles finishes the race first (is the first to reach the screen border ahead of it). The turtles then move forward at a random pace, which is achieved by assigning a random number from 1 to 5 to the distance travelled by a given turtle at any iteration of the code. Once the race is over, a message on the screen informs the player of their success (or failure) in betting. It also allows the player to play endlessly.

This is a simple Python project using the aforementioned modules and methods. It can be easily used to demonstrate their uses to students or demonstrate a simple python application.
